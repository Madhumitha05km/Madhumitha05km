- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that in 2013, the data analysis team at Target famously predicted a teenage girl's pregnancy before her father did? By analyzing her purchasing habits, Target was able to send her coupons for baby-related items, inadvertently revealing her pregnancy. This incident highlighted the power of data analysis in identifying patterns and making accurate predictions.
